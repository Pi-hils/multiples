In a language of your own choosing could you please provide code that iterates in multiples of 7 up until 100, then in multiples of 8 up to 200, then multiples of 9 up to 300. 

Multiples of 7\
Returns the multiple of 7: if 7 divides into in perfectly without any remainders(modulo), up until 100\

Multiples of 8\
Returns the multiple of 8: if 8 divides into in perfectly without any remainders(modulo), up until 200\


Multiples of 9\
Returns the multiple of 9: if 9 divides into in perfectly without any remainders(modulo), up until 200\

Methods: 
multiples_of_7
multiples_of_8
multiples_of_9
